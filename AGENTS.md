# Agent Conventions

ai-devkit provides git conventions and documentation generation as skills for AI coding agents.

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `skills/ai-devkit/SKILL.md` | entry point — conventions + skill directory   |
| `skills/ai-devkit/git/`     | git workflow skills (ship, pr, sync)          |
| `skills/ai-devkit/docs/`    | documentation skills (generate, update, test) |
| `hooks/`                     | session-start hook, platform wrappers         |

## Architecture

- **Ambient conventions** — `hooks/session-start` reads `skills/ai-devkit/SKILL.md` and injects git conventions and the skill directory into the session context at startup. No user action needed.
- **On-demand skills** — detailed workflows (ship, pr, sync, docs) are loaded via the Skill tool when invoked.

## Conventions

1. **Commit messages:** lowercase start, no AI tool names, present tense.
2. **Spec before plan, plan before code.** Separate WHAT from HOW.
3. **Test driven development.** Write the test first, verify it fails, implement, verify it passes.
4. **Review before commit.** AI review checks spec compliance and code quality.
