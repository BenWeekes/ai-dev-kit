## 1. Quick-Start Summary

This standard defines a **three-level documentation architecture (L0 / L1 / L2)** that makes any git repository self-describing for both AI coding agents and human engineers.

| Level  | Name       | What It Is                                              | Token Budget |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **L0** | Repo Card  | Identity + L1 index. Always read first. Single file.    | 300–500      |
| **L1** | Summaries  | Structured summaries for standard work. 8 fixed files.  | 300–600 each |
| **L2** | Deep Dives | Full specs and subsystem docs. Loaded only when needed. | No ceiling   |

**Where docs live:** `docs/ai/` directory in every repository.

**Entry point:** `AGENTS.md` at repo root explains the system and points to `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md`.

**Loading rule:** Start at L0. Load all 8 L1 files (they're small). Go to L2 only when L1 isn't detailed enough.

---

## 2. Introduction and Motivation

### 2.1 The Problem

AI coding agents loading an entire codebase into context is expensive, slow, and error-prone. Agents hallucinate when given too much irrelevant information. Most repositories have either no documentation, or a single sprawling README/wiki that forces full-context loading regardless of the task.

### 2.2 The Insight

80% of agent tasks — config changes, bug fixes, small features — need only the L1 summaries, not the full L2 deep dives. Progressive disclosure exploits this by separating essential working knowledge (L1, loaded upfront) from deep reference material (L2, loaded on demand).

### 2.3 Design Goals

- **Token efficiency** — Minimize context window usage for AI agents (reduces cost, latency, and hallucination)
- **Multi-agent readiness** — Self-describing repos that can be loaded on demand by any orchestration layer
- **Human onboarding** — The same docs serve new engineers joining a team
- **Consistency** — Predictable structure across all enterprise repos enables shared tooling and enterprise-wide repo discovery
- **Framework agnosticism** — Works with any language, framework, or AI tool

### 2.4 Why Not a Skill?

Skills and progressive disclosure docs are structurally similar — both use a tree where a top-level entry gates access to deeper content. But they differ in **loading trigger** and **scoping**, and those differences matter.

|                     | Skills                                                                  | Progressive Disclosure Docs                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loading trigger** | Request matching — activates when a query matches the skill description | Filesystem — loads because you're _in the repo_     |
| **Scoping**         | Portable across repos and contexts                                      | Local to this repo, always                          |
| **Activation**      | On-demand when matched                                                  | Always-on at session start                          |
| **Versioning**      | External to the repo                                                    | Travels with the repo in git — branches, forks, PRs |

The filesystem already provides the right trigger (you're here) and scope (this repo's files). A skill that must always activate for the current repo is just files with extra indirection.

Skills remain the right model for portable, cross-repo capabilities that genuinely need request matching.

## 3. The Standard: L0 / L1 / L2 Architecture

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

```
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │   L0    │  ← Always loaded (1 file, 300-500 tokens)
                    │Repo Card│     Identity + L1 index
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
              ┌──────────┼──────────┐
              ▼          ▼          ▼
         ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
         │L1 File │ │L1 File │ │L1 File │  ← Load ALL at session start (~4,000 tokens total)
         │ Setup  │ │Workflow│ │  Map   │     Structured summaries (× 8 files)
         └────┬───┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
              │
              ▼
         ┌─────────┐
         │L2 Deep  │  ← Load only for complex changes (no ceiling)
         │  Dive   │     Full specs, diagrams, decision records
         └─────────┘

  Frequency of access:  HIGH ◄──────────────────────► LOW
  Token cost per task:  LOW  ◄──────────────────────► HIGH
```

#### Agent Loading Protocol

1. **Load L0.** Read `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md` to identify the repo and see the L1 index.
2. **Load all L1.** Read all 8 files in `docs/ai/L1/`. Total is ~3,500–5,000 tokens — small enough to load upfront. This gives you the critical knowledge for every branch of the repo.
3. **Follow L2 links only if needed.** If an L1 file references a deep dive and the task requires more detail than L1 provides, load the specific L2 document. Never load all L2 docs.

#### Loading Examples

**Config change** ("Update the Redis connection timeout"):

```
Load L0 → load all L1 → 01_setup.md has the answer → done. No L2 needed.
Total: ~4,000–5,500 tokens
```

**Standard feature** ("Add a new /users endpoint"):

```
Load L0 → load all L1 → 05_workflows.md + 04_conventions.md have what you need → done.
Total: ~4,000–5,500 tokens
```

**Complex change** ("Refactor the WebSocket event system"):

```
Load L0 → load all L1 → 02_architecture.md + 06_interfaces.md give overview →
need more detail → deep_dives/websocket_system.md → done.
Total: ~5,500–7,500 tokens
```

> **Why load all L1?** Total L1 is ~3,500–5,000 tokens — roughly the size of a single page of prose. Loading everything upfront means the agent has every critical gotcha, every workflow, every convention from the start. This eliminates wrong guesses about which files are relevant and costs less than a single wasted tool call.

#### Token Budget Targets

| Component                      | Target             | Hard Ceiling                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| L0 (Repo Card)                 | 300–500 tokens     | 600 tokens                  |
| Each L1 file                   | 300–600 tokens     | 800 tokens                  |
| All 8 L1 files combined        | 2,400–4,800 tokens | 6,400 tokens                |
| L0 + all L1 (session baseline) | 2,700–5,300 tokens | 7,000 tokens                |
| L2 files                       | No target          | No ceiling (self-contained) |

---

### 3.2 L0 — The Repo Card

**Purpose:** Single point of entry. Identifies the repo and indexes L1 files. An AI agent reads L0 to orient itself, then loads all 8 L1 files. L0 is the table of contents; L1 is the substance.

**File:** `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md`

#### Required Sections (in order)

1. **Identity Block** — Repo name, one-line description, primary language/framework, deployment target, owning team, repo type, last reviewed date
2. **L1 Index** — The 8 L1 files listed with their one-line purpose statements

That's it. L0 is lean by design. Everything else lives in L1.

#### Why L0 Is Minimal

L0 contains only identity and an index because agents load all L1 upfront. There's no need for routing tables, gotcha summaries, or quick commands in L0 when the total L1 cost is only ~3,500–5,000 tokens. Detailed content lives where it naturally belongs:

| Content               | Lives In                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Core file listings    | `03_code_map.md`                      |
| Quick commands        | `01_setup.md`                         |
| Gotchas               | `07_gotchas.md`                       |
| Task-based navigation | Not needed — agent already has all L1 |

#### Identity Block — Enterprise Discovery

The Identity Block serves double duty: it orients agents working in this repo, AND it enables **enterprise-wide repo discovery**. A central registry can scrape all L0 files across the organization to build a map of every repo, its type, owner, language, and deployment target.

| Field           | Value                  | Discovery Use                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `repo`          | `org/repo-name`        | Unique identifier                 |
| `type`          | `api-service`          | Filter repos by kind              |
| `language`      | `TypeScript + Express` | Find repos by tech stack          |
| `deploy_target` | `AWS ECS (Fargate)`    | Map deployment topology           |
| `owner`         | `Telephony Squad`      | Route questions to the right team |
| `description`   | One-line summary       | Search and browse                 |
| `last_reviewed` | `2026-02-15`           | Track freshness across org        |

#### L0 Template

```

### 3.3 L1 — Structured Summaries

**Purpose:** Structured summaries covering all critical knowledge. Agents load all 8 files at session start (~3,500–5,000 tokens total). This is the primary working knowledge layer — most tasks complete here without needing L2.

**Directory:** `docs/ai/L1/`

#### Standard File Set (8 files — fixed, never omit any)

| #   | File                 | Purpose                       | Typical Content                                                                                    |
| --- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | `01_setup.md`        | Environment and local dev     | Prerequisites, install steps, env vars, local run, quick commands, common setup failures           |
| 02  | `02_architecture.md` | System design at a glance     | Component diagram (ASCII), data flow, key abstractions, tech stack rationale                       |
| 03  | `03_code_map.md`     | Navigate the codebase         | Directory tree with annotations, module responsibilities, core files table                         |
| 04  | `04_conventions.md`  | How we write code here        | Naming, file structure, error handling, logging, testing patterns                                  |
| 05  | `05_workflows.md`    | How to do common tasks        | Step-by-step: add endpoint, add migration, deploy, handle incident                                 |
| 06  | `06_interfaces.md`   | Boundary contracts            | API schemas, event formats, DB schemas, external service contracts                                 |
| 07  | `07_gotchas.md`      | Gotchas and tribal knowledge  | Dangerous pitfalls, incident lessons, environment-specific behaviors                               |
| 08  | `08_security.md`     | Security model and boundaries | Auth model, trust boundaries, secret management, input validation, known vulnerability mitigations |

> **Why 8 files is fixed:** If a repo has no external interfaces, `06_interfaces.md` says "This repo has no external interfaces." It is **not** omitted. Predictability enables tooling and agent expectations.

#### L1 File Rules

- **Starts** with a one-line purpose statement after the title.
- **Ends** with a `## Related Deep Dives` section (links to relevant L2 docs, or "None").
- **Content format:** H2 headers, bullet lists, tables, short code blocks. No narrative prose longer than 3 sentences.
- **Independence:** Each file is independently useful. No required reading order between L1 files.
- **Line budget:** 80–200 lines per file.

#### L1 File Template

```markdown
# [NN] [Title]

> [One-line purpose statement]

## [Section H2]

- Bullet point content
- Structured for scanning, not reading

## [Section H2]

| Column | Column |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data   | Data   |

## Related Deep Dives

- [Topic Name](deep_dives/topic_name.md) — One-line description
- None
```

---

### 3.4 L2 — Deep Dives

**Purpose:** Full architecture docs, specifications, and subsystem deep-dives. Loaded only for complex, cross-cutting changes.

**Directory:** `docs/ai/L1/deep_dives/`

> **Why under L1?** L2 is an _extension_ of L1, not a sibling. An agent navigating from an L1 file to an L2 deep dive follows a simple relative path: `deep_dives/topic_name.md`.

#### Index File (Required)

Every repo with L2 docs MUST have `docs/ai/L1/deep_dives/_index.md`:

```markdown
# Deep Dives Index

| Document                                   | Summary                                  | Load When                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [call_routing.md](call_routing.md)         | SIP call routing logic and decision tree | Modifying call flow or adding routing rules |
| [websocket_system.md](websocket_system.md) | Real-time event system architecture      | Changing WebSocket handlers or event schema |
```

#### Rules

- **Naming:** Lowercase, snake_case, descriptive. No number prefix. No subdirectories.
- **Self-contained:** Each deep dive includes enough context to be read without other L2 docs.
- **"When to Read This" callout:** Every L2 file starts with this callout.
- **No length ceiling,** but chunked into scannable sections with clear H2/H3 structure.
- **When to create:** If an L1 file needs >10 lines to explain a subsystem, that becomes an L2 deep dive.

#### L2 Example: `websocket_system.md`

```markdown
# WebSocket System

> **When to Read This:** Load this document when you are modifying WebSocket event
> handlers, changing the event schema, or debugging real-time notification issues.

## Overview

The WebSocket system provides real-time event notifications to connected clients.
Built on the `ws` library with a pub/sub pattern internally.

## Architecture

    Call Handler ──publish──▶ EventBus ──route──▶ WebSocket Connections
                                │                        │
                                ▼                        ▼
                          Redis Pub/Sub           Client receives
                         (multi-instance)          JSON message

## Event Types

| Event Type           | Payload                          | Published When                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `call.initiated`     | `{ callId, from, to }`           | New inbound/outbound call     |
| `call.state_changed` | `{ callId, oldState, newState }` | Call state machine transition |
| `call.ended`         | `{ callId, reason, duration }`   | Call terminated               |

## Gotchas

- **Redis pub/sub does not persist messages.** Missed events during disconnect
  require REST API polling to catch up.
- **EventBus topic filters use glob syntax, not regex.** `call.*` matches
  `call.initiated` but not `call.state.changed` (use `call.**` for nested topics).

## 4. Base Conventions

These rules apply to **every repository** regardless of type, language, or framework.

### 4.1 Directory Structure

```
repo-root/
├── AGENTS.md                              # Universal AI entry point
├── CLAUDE.md                              # Thin redirect to AGENTS.md

                ├── call_routing.md        # Example L2 files
                └── websocket_system.md
```

**Rules:**

- The `docs/ai/` path is **mandatory** and must not be changed or aliased.
- No files outside `docs/ai/` are part of the progressive disclosure system (except `AGENTS.md` at repo root).
- No other files may be added to `L1/` besides the 8 standard files and the `deep_dives/` directory.

### 4.2 File Naming Rules

| Level    | Naming Rule                                    | Examples                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| L0       | Exact name: `L0_repo_card.md`                  | `L0_repo_card.md`                 |
| L1       | `NN_name.md` — zero-padded number + snake_case | `01_setup.md`, `05_workflows.md`  |
| L2       | snake_case, no number prefix                   | `call_routing.md`, `auth_flow.md` |
| L2 Index | Exact name: `_index.md`                        | `_index.md`                       |

- L1 files use the exact names listed in Section 3.3. No variations.
- L2 file names: descriptive nouns, not verbs (`auth_flow.md` not `authenticate.md`).
- No subdirectories within `deep_dives/` — flat structure only.

### 4.3 Linking Patterns

All links between progressive disclosure files use **relative paths**:

| From           | To                                                | Pattern                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| L0 → L1        | `[Setup](L1/01_setup.md)`                         | Relative from `docs/ai/` |
| L1 → L2        | `[Call Routing](deep_dives/call_routing.md)`      | Relative from `L1/`      |
| L2 → L2        | `[Auth Flow](auth_flow.md)`                       | Same directory           |
| L2 → L1        | `[Back to Interfaces](../06_interfaces.md)`       | Parent directory         |
| Any → External | `[API Docs](https://docs.example.com) [EXTERNAL]` | Full URL with marker     |

**Rules:**

- Never use absolute paths. Never link outside `docs/ai/`.
- If a doc references source code files, use inline code (`` `src/routes/index.ts` ``) not a link.
- Mark external URLs with `[EXTERNAL]`.

### 4.4 Content Density Targets

| Level | Lines per File  | Prose                              | Tables     | Code Blocks    |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| L0    | 30–50           | None (tables only)                 | Required   | None           |
| L1    | 80–200 per file | Minimal (≤3 sentences per section) | Encouraged | Short examples |
| L2    | No ceiling      | Allowed (but structured)           | Yes        | Full examples  |

**Aggregate budgets:**

| Metric                       | Target    | Maximum |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| L0 lines                     | 30–50     | 60      |
| Total L1 lines (all 8 files) | 800–1,400 | 1,600   |
| Total L0 + L1 lines          | 830–1,450 | 1,660   |

### 4.5 Anti-Patterns

Do NOT put any of the following in `docs/ai/`:

| Anti-Pattern                                                | Why                                                             | Where It Belongs                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicating the README                                      | Creates two sources of truth that drift apart                   | README stays at repo root; L1 is structured differently         |
| Auto-generated API docs (Swagger/TypeDoc output)            | Goes stale, inflates token count, already available from source | Link from `06_interfaces.md` with `[EXTERNAL]` marker           |
| Operational runbooks (incident response, on-call playbooks) | Too long, changes frequently, audience is ops not developers    | Wiki or runbook system; link from `07_gotchas.md` if critical   |
| Full database migration history                             | Unbounded growth, low signal                                    | `06_interfaces.md` covers current schema; link to migration dir |
| Commented-out "previous versions" of docs                   | Noise; git has history                                          | Delete and rely on version control                              |

**Rule of thumb:** If content is auto-generated, unbounded in growth, or has a better canonical home elsewhere — link to it, don't copy it.

### 4.6 Freshness and Maintenance

#### When to Update

| Trigger                                | What to Update                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| New critical file or module added      | L1 `03_code_map.md`                       |
| Workflow changes                       | L1 `05_workflows.md`                      |
| Gotcha discovered in incident          | L1 `07_gotchas.md`                        |
| API contract changes                   | L1 `06_interfaces.md`                     |
| Subsystem undergoes significant change | Relevant L2 deep dive                     |
| New external dependency added          | L1 `01_setup.md`, L1 `02_architecture.md` |

#### Freshness Tracking

- The `last_reviewed` date in L0's Identity Block should be updated whenever any `docs/ai/` file is modified.

#### CI Check (Recommended)

Check freshness per-file so a single update doesn't reset the clock for everything:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Check docs freshness
  run: |
    threshold=$(( $(date +%s) - 90 * 86400 ))
    stale=""
    for f in docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md docs/ai/L1/*.md; do
      [ -f "$f" ] || continue
      last=$(git log -1 --format="%ct" -- "$f" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
      if [ "$last" -lt "$threshold" ]; then
        stale="$stale $f"
      fi
    done
    if [ -n "$stale" ]; then
      echo "::warning::Stale docs (>90 days):$stale"
    fi
```

> **Note:** Uses POSIX-compatible `date +%s` arithmetic instead of GNU-only `date -d`. Works on both Linux and macOS CI runners.

### 4.7 AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md Integration

Every repo should have an `AGENTS.md` at the root that serves as the **universal entry point for all AI tools**. `CLAUDE.md` is a thin redirect.

#### AGENTS.md Template

```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

This repository uses progressive disclosure documentation to help AI coding
agents work efficiently. Documentation is structured in three levels under
`docs/ai/`.

## How to Load

1. Read [docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md](docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md) to identify the repo.
2. Load ALL 8 files in `docs/ai/L1/`. They are small — load all of them upfront.
   This gives you setup, architecture, code map, conventions, workflows,
   interfaces, gotchas, and security.
3. If a task needs more detail than L1 provides, follow links to L2 deep dives
   in `docs/ai/L1/deep_dives/`. Load only the specific L2 file
   you need.

## Levels

- **L0 (Repo Card):** Identity and L1 index. Table of contents.
- **L1 (Summaries):** Eight structured summaries. Load all at session start.
- **L2 (Deep Dives):** Full specifications. Load only when L1 isn't detailed enough.
```

#### CLAUDE.md Template

Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` into the system prompt automatically. Use an `@` reference so Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` at session start without an extra tool call:

```markdown
Read @AGENTS.md for AI agent instructions and progressive disclosure docs.
```

#### Why This Pattern

- **`AGENTS.md`** is the universal standard (Linux Foundation). All AI tools will look for it.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** uses an `@` reference so Claude Code loads `AGENTS.md` into the system prompt automatically — no tool call needed.
- **Other tools** (Cursor, Copilot, Cody, etc.) can all read `AGENTS.md`.
- **Future enterprise map:** A central system can scrape all `AGENTS.md` files to discover repos, then follow the link to each L0 for Identity Block metadata.

---

## 5. Specializing for Repo Types

### Key Principle

> **The 8-file L1 structure is universal. Specialization is in content, not structure.**

The L0 Identity Block includes a `repo_type` field. Valid values: `api-service`, `frontend-app`, `sdk-library`, `infrastructure`, `distributed-system`, `data-pipeline`, `ml-model`, `mobile-app`.

Specialization manifests in:

1. **L1 file content emphasis** — which topics each file focuses on
2. **L2 deep dive topics** — which subsystems need full docs
3. Agents and tooling never need repo-type-specific branching for structure.

## State Management

- **Never run `terraform apply` locally against production.** All production applies
  go through CI/CD. Local applies are only for dev environments.
- **State file locking uses DynamoDB.** If a lock is stuck, check `terraform-locks`
  table before force-unlocking.
- **Moving resources between modules requires `terraform state mv`.** Simply cutting
  and pasting HCL will destroy and recreate the resource.

## Cost Surprises

- **NAT Gateways cost ~$32/month each, plus data transfer.** We have one per AZ (3 total).
- **RDS Multi-AZ doubles the instance cost.** Enabled in prod only.

## Environment Differences

| Resource           | Dev           | Staging        | Prod              |

### 5.5 Adaptation Notes for Other Repo Types

#### Distributed System

A distributed system spanning multiple repos gets its own **system repo** — a dedicated repo (type: `distributed-system`) that documents the system as a whole. Each component repo has its own `docs/ai/` tree as usual. The system repo ties them together.

#### L1 Content Emphasis

| File                 | Distributed System Focus                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `01_setup.md`        | Standing up the full system locally, docker-compose, service mesh, shared tooling                     |
| `02_architecture.md` | Service topology, communication patterns (sync/async, REST/gRPC/events), request flow across services |
| `03_code_map.md`     | Repo map — which repos exist, their types, owners, relationships, links to each repo's L0             |
| `04_conventions.md`  | Cross-repo conventions, shared schema versioning, API contract rules                                  |
| `05_workflows.md`    | "Add a new service," "Deploy across services," "Trace a request," "Coordinate a breaking change"      |
| `06_interfaces.md`   | Cross-service API contracts, event schemas, shared database boundaries                                |
| `07_gotchas.md`      | Deployment ordering, partial failures, eventual consistency, cross-service debugging                  |
| `08_security.md`     | Cross-service auth flow, network segmentation, trust boundaries, secret distribution                  |

#### Typical L2 Deep Dives

- `service_topology.md` — Full service dependency graph with communication protocols
- `deployment_coordination.md` — Deploy ordering, rollback strategy, canary patterns
- `cross_service_auth.md` — End-to-end auth flow across service boundaries

**`03_code_map.md` must include a repo index:**

Each repo has its own `docs/ai/` tree. Clone and read its L0 to start.
```

#### Data Pipeline

Follows **API service** pattern. Key content shifts:

- `02_architecture.md` — DAG/pipeline graph, sources → transforms → sinks
- `06_interfaces.md` — Schema definitions (input/output), SLA contracts, data quality rules
- `05_workflows.md` — "Add a pipeline stage," "Backfill historical data," "Handle schema evolution"
- **L2 topics:** `data_lineage.md`, `schema_registry.md`, `backfill_procedures.md`

#### ML Model Repo

Follows **SDK/library** pattern. Key content shifts:

- `02_architecture.md` — Training vs serving architecture, feature pipeline diagram
- `05_workflows.md` — "Retrain model," "Deploy model version," "A/B test a variant"
- `06_interfaces.md` — Model I/O schemas, feature definitions, hyperparameter config
- `07_gotchas.md` — Training/serving skew, feature leakage, GPU memory limits
- **L2 topics:** `training_pipeline.md`, `feature_engineering.md`, `model_evaluation.md`

# Task: Generate Progressive Disclosure Documentation

You are a documentation agent. Analyze this codebase and generate progressive
disclosure documentation under `docs/ai/`.

## The Standard

Read the full standard before starting:
https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit/blob/main/docs/progressive-disclosure-standard.md

Key constraints to keep in mind:

- **L0** (Repo Card): Identity Block + L1 Index. 30-50 lines. No prose.
- **L1** (Summaries): Exactly 8 files (01-08), 80-200 lines each. All 8 loaded at session start.
- **L2** (Deep Dives): Under `deep_dives/`, with `_index.md`. Self-contained. No ceiling.
- **Linking:** Relative paths only within `docs/ai/`. External URLs marked `[EXTERNAL]`.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Read Existing Project Context

Read all markdown files and config/setup files in the repo root first. These
contain project decisions, conventions, and context that should inform the
generated docs:

- All `*.md` files (README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Config files: package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, Dockerfile,
  docker-compose.yml, Makefile, CI config — whatever exists
- Setup scripts: init.sh, bootstrap.sh, setup.py, etc.

### Step 2: Map the Repository Structure

1. List directory structure (top 3 levels).
2. Identify repo type: api-service, frontend-app, sdk-library, infrastructure,
   distributed-system, data-pipeline, ml-model, or mobile-app.
3. Identify the major modules, packages, or service boundaries. For each one,
   note its directory path and apparent responsibility.

### Step 3: Deep-Read Each Module

For each major module or directory identified in Step 2:

1. Read all source files in the module (or a representative set if the module
   is very large — aim for full coverage where feasible).
2. Summarize: purpose, key abstractions, public interfaces, internal patterns,
   external dependencies, and any gotchas found (TODO/FIXME/HACK comments,
   complex conditionals, retry logic, environment-specific behavior).

For large repos, analyze each module as a separate task and collect the
summaries before moving to Step 4. Use sub-agents or multiple passes as
your tool supports.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Plan

Using the module summaries from Step 3:

1. Map the primary data flow across the whole system (request lifecycle,
   component hierarchy, module graph, or resource dependency graph).
2. Identify coding conventions that are consistent across modules.
3. Identify all external interfaces (APIs, databases, queues, caches).
4. Compile gotchas from all modules.
5. List key topics for each L1 file (3-5 per file).
6. Identify 2-4 L2 deep dive topics.

## Output

Create files one at a time in this order:

1. `mkdir -p docs/ai/L1/deep_dives`
2. `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md` — Identity Block + L1 Index table
3. L1 files 01 through 08
4. `docs/ai/L1/deep_dives/_index.md`
5. L2 deep dive files
6. Verify all cross-references resolve

## Also create: AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md

Create `AGENTS.md` at the repo root (the universal AI entry point):

```
# AI Agent Instructions

This repository uses progressive disclosure documentation.

1. Read [docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md](docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md) to identify the repo.
2. Load ALL 8 files in docs/ai/L1/.
3. Follow L2 deep dive links only when L1 isn't detailed enough for your task.
```

If `CLAUDE.md` exists, add a line pointing to AGENTS.md:

```
Read @AGENTS.md for AI agent instructions and progressive disclosure docs.
```

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it:

```
Read @AGENTS.md for AI agent instructions and progressive disclosure docs.
```

## Quality Checklist

**L0:** Identity Block with repo_type + last_reviewed. L1 Index table with all 8 files. ≤50 lines. No prose.

**L1:** All 8 files exist. Each starts with purpose statement, ends with Related Deep Dives. 80-200 lines each. Total ≤1,600.

**L2:** \_index.md exists. ≥2 deep dives. Each starts with "When to Read This." All self-contained.

**CLAUDE.md:** Exists at repo root. References @AGENTS.md.

**Links:** All relative. All resolve. None point outside docs/ai/.

## 7. Prompt: Bootstrap Docs for a New Repo

Copy the entire fenced block below into an AI coding agent. For repos with **little or no code yet**.

> **Usage notes:**
>
> - The agent asks a questionnaire then generates starter docs with specific TODO markers
> - L2 content files are NOT generated — just the index
> - Re-run the existing-repo prompt (Section 6) once the codebase has taken shape

# Task: Bootstrap Progressive Disclosure Documentation for a New Repo

You are a documentation agent. Help an engineer set up progressive disclosure
documentation for a new repository with little or no code yet.

## Gather Information

Ask the engineer (or extract from context):

1. **Repo name** and **one-line description**
2. **Repo type:** api-service, frontend-app, sdk-library, infrastructure,
   distributed-system, data-pipeline, ml-model
3. **Primary language and framework**
4. **Key external dependencies** (databases, queues, third-party APIs)
5. **Deployment target** (AWS ECS, Vercel, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.)
6. **Anticipated directory structure** (src/, lib/, modules/, packages/)

## The Standard

Read the full standard before starting:
https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit/blob/main/docs/progressive-disclosure-standard.md

Key constraints for bootstrapping:

- **L0** (Repo Card): Identity Block + L1 Index. 30-50 lines. No prose.
- **L1** (Summaries): Exactly 8 files (01-08), 80-200 lines each. All loaded at session start.
- **L2:** Generate only `_index.md` with anticipated topics. No content files yet.

## TODO Marker Convention

Use SPECIFIC TODO markers — never generic ones:

GOOD:

```
<!-- TODO: Document actual database schema once models are created -->
<!-- TODO: List actual environment variables from .env.example once created -->
```

BAD:

```
<!-- TODO: Fill in later -->
<!-- TODO: TBD -->
```

Every TODO must say WHAT to document and WHEN to do it.

## Output

Create files one at a time:

1. `mkdir -p docs/ai/L1/deep_dives`
2. `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md` — Fill Identity from questionnaire. L1 Index.
3. L1 files 01-08 — Fill what you can from tech stack knowledge, TODO the rest.
   All 8 must exist even if mostly TODOs.
4. `docs/ai/L1/deep_dives/_index.md` — 3-5 anticipated topics,
   all marked "To be created." No content files.
5. `AGENTS.md` at repo root — Instructs agents to load L0 then all L1.
6. `CLAUDE.md` at repo root — References @AGENTS.md. If it already exists, add
   the @ reference rather than replacing existing content.

## Quality Checklist

**L0:** Identity filled from questionnaire. L1 Index complete. ≤50 lines.

**L1:** All 8 exist. Purpose statements present. All TODOs are specific.

**L2:** \_index.md only. No content files created.

**AGENTS.md:** Exists at repo root. Instructs: load L0, then all L1, then L2 only if needed.

**CLAUDE.md:** Exists at repo root. References @AGENTS.md.

### 8.3 Adoption Checklist

1. **Classify** — Determine `repo_type`, language, deploy target, owner
2. **Generate** — Copy prompt from Section 6 into an AI agent with repo access
3. **Review** — Verify architecture, interfaces, workflows, gotchas for accuracy
4. **Fill gaps** — Add incident-learned gotchas, deployment runbooks, tribal knowledge
5. **Integrate** — Create `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, add note to `README.md`
6. **Maintain** — Update `docs/ai/` when code changes, update `last_reviewed` in L0
7. **Monitor** (optional) — CI freshness check, track L2 load frequency

### 8.4 FAQ

**Q: Can I add L1 files beyond the 8?**
A: No. Additional content goes in L2 deep dives. If an L1 file doesn't apply, it says "Not applicable" — it is not omitted.

**Q: Can I use this with non-Claude agents?**
A: Yes. Everything is tool-agnostic markdown. `AGENTS.md` is the universal entry point.

**Q: How does this work with multi-repo distributed systems?**
A: Create a dedicated system repo (type: `distributed-system`) that documents the system as a whole. Each component repo has its own `docs/ai/` tree as usual. See Section 5.5.

**Q: Why load all L1 instead of picking files per task?**
A: Total L1 is ~3,500–5,000 tokens — less than a single page of prose. Loading everything upfront eliminates wrong guesses about which files matter and costs less than a single wasted tool call. The real cost savings come from not loading L2 unless you need it.

**Q: What if L0 exceeds 50 lines?**
A: L0 should only contain Identity Block + L1 Index. If it's growing beyond that, content belongs in L1.

**Q: How do we build an enterprise repo map?**
A: Scrape all `L0_repo_card.md` files across repos. The Identity Block (name, type, language, owner, deploy target) provides structured metadata for a central registry.

**Q: What if the agent generates incorrect docs?**
A: Expected for domain-specific content. Agents excel at structural generation but miss tribal knowledge. Always review with a senior engineer.
